## 🏗 Architecture Highlights

### Professional Code Structure
```
src/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── constants/       # App configuration and constants
├── navigation/      # Navigation setup and configuration
├── screens/         # Screen components organized by feature
├── services/        # API services with mock implementations
├── store/          # Redux state management
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/          # Helper utilities and functions
```

### Technology Stack Used
- **React Native 0.82.0** - Latest stable version
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **React Navigation v6** - Navigation system
- **React Native Paper** - Material Design UI
- **Formik + Yup** - Form handling and validation
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **React Native Chart Kit** - Data visualization
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data persistence

## 🛠 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Fix Dependencies (if needed)
If you encounter npm install issues, try:
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Or use yarn as alternative
yarn install
```

### 2. Install Missing Dependencies
Some dependencies may need manual installation:
```bash
npm install date-fns react-native-reanimated
```

### 3. Platform Setup

#### Android Setup:
```bash
# Run Android version
npx react-native run-android
```

#### iOS Setup (macOS only):
```bash
# Install pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
# Run iOS version  
npx react-native run-ios
```

### 4. Backend Integration
The app currently uses mock services. To integrate with a real backend:
1. Update `API_BASE_URL` in `src/constants/index.ts`
2. Replace mock implementations in service files
3. Update API response formats to match your backend

## 📱 Features Demonstration

### Authentication Flow
1. Open app → Login screen appears
2. Use demo credentials or register new account
3. Successful login redirects to dashboard

### Customer Management
1. Navigate to Customers tab
2. View paginated customer list
3. Use search to filter customers
4. Tap customer to view details
5. Use FAB (+) to add new customers
6. Edit/Delete using action buttons

### Lead Management
1. From customer details, manage associated leads
2. Create leads with different statuses
3. Update lead status and values
4. Track conversion progress

### Analytics Dashboard
1. View real-time metrics
2. Interactive pie chart for lead status distribution
3. Bar chart for detailed analytics
4. Pull to refresh for updated data
